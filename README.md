# Student Grade Management System

This program is a simple yet powerful tool to manage student marks. You can use it to calculate the average, highest, and lowest marks among a group of students. The program is built using Java and follows an object-oriented approach for clarity and modularity.

## What Does This Program Do?

- Add Student Details: Enter a student's name and marks.
- Calculate Average Marks: Get the average of all student marks.
- Find Maximum and Minimum Marks: Discover the highest and lowest marks from the group.
